Hello there! 😺

🗨 I'm a Salmon Biologist at Trout Unlimited and an Affiliate Scientist in the Fisheries Collaborative Program at University of California Santa Cruz. 

🧮 I specialize in salmon ecology, population models, and quantitatve methods. 
I enjoy thinking about how diversity evolves and how natural selection maintains it in fishes. 

⚡ I'm currently working on population genetic models for hatchery-wild metapopulations.

⚓ I grew up in Anchorage Alaska in a family that fished commercially and recreationally. 
I am proud to support Trout Unlimited's mission to make sure future generations, including my son,
have fishing opportunites. 

📫 How to reach me: haley.ohms@tu.org

🎏 Fun fact: I've done field work in Japan, Greenland, and remote Alaska.
