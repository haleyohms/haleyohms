Hello there! 😺

🗨 I'm a Salmon Biologist at Trout Unlimited and an Affiliate Researcher in the Fisheries Collaborative Program at University of California Santa Cruz. 

🧮 I specialize in salmon ecology, population models, and quantitatve methods. 

⚡ I'm currently working on population genetic models for hatchery-wild metapopulations.

🔭 I enjoy thinking about how life history diversity evolved and how it's currently maintained in fishes. 

⚓ I grew up in Anchorage Alaska in a family that fished commercially and recreationally. My work is motivated by making sure my son has the same fishing opportunities I did.

🎏 Fun fact: I've done field work in Japan, Greenland, and remote Alaska.
